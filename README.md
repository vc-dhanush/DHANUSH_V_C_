Nothing Just about myself....................


# 💫 About Me:
<br># 🧑‍💻 About Me – Dhanush<br><br>* 👋 **Hello World!** I’m **Dhanush V C **, an engineering student currently living in the land of semicolons, infinite loops, and midnight bug hunts. My life is basically a giant `while(true)` loop of learning, coding, and occasionally crashing (both me and my laptop 🖥️🔥).<br><br>* 🎓 **Studies:**<br><br>  * Pursuing my undergraduate degree in engineering, where I juggle *assignments, labs, projects,* and a very personal research on *“How much coffee an average coder needs to survive exams.”* ☕<br>  * My college life has been a mix of **technical growth** and **accidental Ctrl+S moments** where I save the wrong file and wonder why my code won’t run.<br><br>* ⚡ **Technical Playground:**<br><br>  * 📱 Android App Development with **Kotlin** – because Java felt like eating pizza without cheese.<br>  * 🐍 AI & Machine Learning with **Python** – my daily partner in crime (except when `pip install` breaks).<br>  * 👀 Computer Vision wizardry – OCR, YOLO, Inpainting, Neural Style Transfer – teaching machines to *see, fix, and sometimes hallucinate*.<br>  * ✍️ Project: Handwritten notes ➝ Digital text – turning my unreadable handwriting into something even Google Docs can respect.<br><br>* 🚀 **Hackathon Explorer:**<br><br>  * Survived multiple hackathons, from national to international levels.<br>  * 46-hour marathons powered by **coffee, Red Bull, and Git commits at 3 AM**.<br>  * Learned that coding with teammates is like using GitHub – fun until someone force pushes to main.<br><br>* 🏅 **Quiz & Competitions:**<br><br>  * 🏆 RBI All India Quiz (where I proved I know about money even though my wallet says otherwise).<br>  * 🎤 Blissbeat Quiz, IEEE events, national-level tech fests – sharpening not just my brain but also my *Google-speed reflexes*.<br>  * Learned the golden rule: *If you don’t know the answer, at least make the wrong one sound confident.*<br><br>* 💡 **Projects in my Repository of Life:**<br><br>  * 🩸🚫 **Non-Invasive Blood Glucose Monitoring System** using NIR + AI – because needles are scary, but algorithms are scarier.<br>  * 😃😐😢 **Emotion Detection System** – detects employee moods so HR can intervene before the keyboard gets smashed.<br>  * 🌍 Freelance Apps & Websites – where I learned the ancient art of **“client requirements always change”**.<br>  * 🎙️ Solo Podcast – because talking to myself felt lonely, so I added a mic.<br><br>* 🎨 **Creative Side:**<br><br>  * Love for **minimalist art** 🖼️ – simple but meaningful, kind of like a good “Hello World” program.<br>  * 🎧 Podcasting & content creation – where my ideas go from “just a thought” ➝ “maybe someone will actually listen to this.”<br>  * Mixing creativity + code = memes in code comments, because future me deserves entertainment while debugging.<br><br>* 🌱 **Personal Growth:**<br><br>  * Shy 🙈 by default, but slowly upgrading to **“Social v2.0”** with better communication skills and fewer awkward silences.<br>  * Continuous learner – half my wisdom comes from **Stack Overflow** and the other half from bugs I accidentally created.<br>  * Personal motto: *“If it compiles, it ships. If it doesn’t, Google until it does.”*<br><br>* 🔮 **Future Goals:**<br><br>  * Becoming a skilled **Android & AI Developer** 🤖.<br>  * Building tech that actually helps people, from healthcare innovations to productivity tools 🌍.<br>  * Keep blending tech + humor – because life’s too short for boring code.<br><br>* 🤝 **Open to Connections:**<br><br>  * Always excited to meet fellow coders, AI enthusiasts, developers, and anyone who appreciates late-night debugging stories.<br>  * If you’re into **AI, app dev, hackathons, or memes about 404 errors**, we’ll probably vibe instantly.<br><br>
